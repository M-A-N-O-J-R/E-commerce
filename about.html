            <p>Naser-Al-Azzeh is a Jordanian dancer who is the founder of the dance group Black Ice Crew.

                Vineeth "Beep" Kumar is a beat-boxer who has interviewed Salman Khan, A.R. Rahman, Shahrukh Khan, Mika, the cast of The Avengers etc. 
                
                In a recent interview with Jaby Koay, Naser and Vineeth said that they met while in college in 2007. Their love of Russell Peters made them friends, especially when they realised that they actually lived in the same neighbourhood. They were initially going to make 3 videos and share them to others on social media and the target was 10,000 views. However, the 3 videos had such a good following, they decided to start a Youtube channel, and for a while they didn't put anything on it. They reached the trending list in India with their parody of the Fast and Furious 8 trailer. When Naser and Vineeth realized that the fast and furious video had hit 1 million views, they decided that they would do the channel full time. So they quit their jobs and began making videos. When Naser initially floated the idea of Jordindian a few years ago, Vineeth thought it wouldn’t work. "Clearly, I was wrong", Vineeth said in a 2019 interview.
                
                They were featured in YouTube Rewind 2018.</p>
